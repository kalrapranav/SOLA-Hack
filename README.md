# SOLA-Hack
The following Repository contains the work thta was completefd at teh SOLA-hack. 
SOLA-hack was a design hackthon, where we were challenged to comeup with a solution for multiple issues
faced by the people of color in Southern Los Angles area. 

## Problems 
Our Team decided to come with a solution for problem of people being undocument and not haivng proper form of Identification.   
We found out that the probelm of being without documents lead to a series fo crisis events such as: 
* No healthcare
* No Social Serucity 
* Can't get a mode of transportaion (such as car, motorbike)
* Can't apply for jobs

This leads to a vicious cycle and further worsening their conditions. 

## Solution
After internsive research our team decided to create a portal which makes it straight forward and easier for people
to get the documents.  
Our solution removes the middle men and make them knwo the true meaning of FREEDOM.

I created a webscrapping algoritm to get the information of people not having identification to improve the research
for our team and the data is stored in a excel file [there](https://github.com/kalrapranav/SOLA-Hack/blob/master/Research/Research.xlsx).  
The deck for out final presentation is [there](https://github.com/kalrapranav/SOLA-Hack/blob/master/Deck/KeyIDSOLA%20hack%20-%20deck.pdf)
